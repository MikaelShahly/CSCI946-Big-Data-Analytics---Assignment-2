# CSCI946-Big-Data-Analytics---Assignment-2
The objective is to accurately identify and classify Twitter profiles as either human or
non-human, a task crucial for maintaining the platform's integrity and mitigating the spread of
misinformation, spam, and malicious activities. The rise of bots on social media can distort
public opinion, inflate follower counts, and lead to real-world consequences for users and
policymakers. Identifying these bots is challenging due to their ability to mimic human
behavior and operate on a large scale. Thus, the project aims to develop a scalable and
adaptive machine learning model that can continuously identify and mitigate such threats
using the twitter_user_data dataset, which includes data from 20,000 random tweets.
